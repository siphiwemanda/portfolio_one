*<u>**Udacity** **Nanodegree**</u>*

https://siphiwemanda.github.io/portfolio_one/

This started as the FEND Udacity project two a simple portfolio site using HTML and CSS styles.

The final result had to fit the following criteria.

The page at minimum includes all of the following:

- at least 4 images
- title text (h1, h2, etc.)
- regular (paragraph) text
- a logo.



HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.

No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a `CSS` class or id.

Grid based layout using flex box.

Cross platform compatibility.

I then began to expand on the project using the new skills i had learn throughout the course adding
Javascript and working on cleaning up spagettii code 


The portfolio utilises the following
* Sweetalert https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/ for the alert function
* Animate css https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ for the animation on css
