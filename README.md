Front End Web Design 

Project Two

This project you build a simple portfolio site using HTML and CSS styles. 

The final result had to fit the following criteria.



The page at minimum includes all of the following:

- at least 4 images
- title text (h1, h2, etc.)
- regular (paragraph) text
- a logo.



HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.

No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a `CSS` class or id.



Grid based layout using flex box. 



Cross platform compatibility.
